## Preview & Installation

### Preview

The theme ships with an `exampleSite` folder that acts as a demo setup.
`cd` into this folder an start the Hugo:

    git clone https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme.git
    cd hugo-minimalist-theme/exampleSite
    hugo server
 
Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.

### Installation

If you want to use this theme for an actual website create a new Hugo project and clone the theme:

    cd themes
    git clone https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme.git

**Note:** make sure to remove `themesDir = "../.."` from the top of your config file if you copied it from `exampleSite/config.toml`. Otherwise, Hugo will be unable to find the theme.

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

### The Config File

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme/tree/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme.
You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml).

To use it, copy the [`config.toml`](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) to the root folder of your Hugo site.
Play around with the settings to tweak your site as you like.

## Localization (l10n)

Localization allows you to easily translate all strings in our website.
Within [`exampleSite/data`](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme/tree/master/exampleSite/data) you'll find a file called [`l10n.toml`](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/data/l10n.toml).
If you're not blogging in English replace all strings with their equivalents of your preferred language.
